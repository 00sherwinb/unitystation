## Todo vs Feature vs bug:
Please take note of the difference between a TODO and Feature
* Bug: An unexpected behaviour of the game and/or server. Including, but not limited to, errors and warnings.
* Todo: When you come across something that needs tweaking/adding during development, is not an unexpected behaviour
* Feature: When you, out of personal preference, want something added or changed.
